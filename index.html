   <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>
   
   <p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at family gatherings. My grandmother recommends.</p>
   
   <p>*Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room tempurature before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm.</p>
